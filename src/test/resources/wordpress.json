The way we do that in Stitch is with Functions. Let\u2019s set up a <em>putKinesisRecord</em> function.</p>\n<p>Select Functions from the left-hand menu, and click Create New Function. Provide a name for the function and paste the following in the body of the function.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://webassets.mongodb.com/_com_assets/cms/image6-7wtiny60ji.gif\" alt=\"Figure 5. Example Function - putKinesisRecord\" /></p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">exports = function(event){\r\n const awsService = context.services.get('aws');\r\ntry{\r\n   awsService.kinesis().PutRecord({\r\n     Data: JSON.stringify(event.fullDocument),\r\n     StreamName: \"stitchStream\",\r\n     PartitionKey: \"1\"\r\n      }).then(function(response) {\r\n        return response;\r\n      });\r\n}\r\ncatch(error){\r\n  console.log(JSON.parse(error));\r\n}\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"testoutthefunction\">Test Out the Function</h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s make sure everything is working by calling that function manually. From the <strong>Function Editor</strong>, Click <strong>Console</strong> to view the interactive javascript console for Stitch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1536044162image9-utm60qwobl.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"947\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168430\" /></p>\n<p>Functions called from Triggers require an event. To test execution of our function, we\u2019ll need to pass a dummy event to the function. Creating variables from the console in Stitch is simple. Simply set the value of the variable to a JSON document. For our simple example, use the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">event = {\r\n   \"operationType\": \"replace\",\r\n   \"fullDocument\": {\r\n       \"color\": \"black\",\r\n       \"inventory\": {\r\n           \"$numberInt\": \"1\"\r\n       },\r\n       \"overview\": \"test document\",\r\n       \"price\": {\r\n           \"$numberDecimal\": \"123\"\r\n       },\r\n       \"type\": \"backpack\"\r\n   },\r\n   \"ns\": {\r\n       \"db\": \"streamdata\",\r\n       \"coll\": \"clickdata\"\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nexports(event);\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Paste the above into the console and click the button labeled <strong>Run Function As</strong>. Select a user and the function will execute.</p>\n<p>Ta-da!</p>\n<h3 id=\"puttingittogetherwithstitchtriggers\">Putting It Together with Stitch Triggers</h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve got our MongoDB collection living in Atlas, receiving events from our web app. We\u2019ve got our Kinesis stream ready for data. We\u2019ve got a Stitch Function that can put data into a Kinesis stream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/mongodb/triggers/\">Configuring Stitch Triggers</a> is so simple it\u2019s almost anticlimactic. Click <strong>Triggers</strong> from the left navigation, name your trigger, provide the database and collection context, and select the database events Stitch will react to with execution of a function.</p>\n<p>For the database and collection, use the names from step one. Now we\u2019ll set the operations we want to watch with our trigger. (Some triggers might care about all of them \u2013 inserts, updates, deletes, and replacements \u2013 while others can be more efficient because they logically can only matter for some of those.) In our case, we\u2019re going to watch for insert, update and replace operations.</p>\n<p>Now we specify our <em>putKinesisRecord</em> function as the linked function, and we\u2019re done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1536044235image4-mkz3w061j6.gif\" alt=\"Figure 6. Trigger Configuration in Stitch\" width=\"1430\" height=\"928\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168431\" /></p>\n<p>As part of trigger execution, Stitch will forward details associated with the trigger event, including the full document involved in the event (i.e. the newly inserted, updated, or deleted document from the collection.) This is where we can evaluate some condition or attribute of the incoming document and decide whether or not to put the record onto a stream.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testthetrigger\">Test the Trigger!</h3>\n<p>Amazon provides a dashboard which will enable you to view details associated with the data coming into your stream.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1536044263image3-fbdbnbh0zx.png\" alt=\"Figure 7. Kinesis Stream Monitoring\" width=\"1878\" height=\"1021\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168432\" /></p>\n<p>As you execute the function from within Stitch, you\u2019ll begin to see the data entering the Kinesis stream.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingmorefunctionality\">Building More Functionality</h3>\n<p>So far our trigger is pretty basic \u2013 it watches a collection and when any updates or inserts happen, it feeds the entire document to our Kinesis stream. From here we can build out some more intelligent functionality. To wrap up this post, let\u2019s look at what we can do with the data once it\u2019s been durably stored in MongoDB and placed into a stream.</p>\n<p>Once the record is in the Kinesis Stream you can configure additional services downstream to act on the data. A common use case incorporates Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to perform analytics on the streaming data. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-analytics/\">Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics</a> offers pre-configured templates to accomplish things like anomaly detection, simple alerts, aggregations, and more.</p>\n<p>For example, our stream of data will contain orders resulting from purchases. These orders may originate from point-of-sale systems, as well as from our web-based e-commerce application. Kinesis Analytics can be leveraged to create applications that process the incoming stream of data. For our example, we could build a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/app-anomaly-detection.html\">machine learning algorithm</a> to detect anomalies in the data or create a product performance leaderboard from a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/sliding-window-concepts.html\">sliding</a>, or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/tumbling-window-concepts.html\">tumbling</a> window of data from our stream.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1536044289image7-5c0nd1hscb.png\" alt=\"Figure 8. Amazon Data Analytics - Anomaly Detection Example\" width=\"1203\" height=\"676\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168433\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"wrappingup\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Now you can connect MongoDB to Kinesis. From here, you\u2019re able to leverage any one of the many services offered from Amazon Web Services to build on your application. In our next article in the series, we\u2019ll focus on getting the data back from Kinesis into MongoDB.
